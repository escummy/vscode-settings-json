## Settings File Locations

Depending on your platform, workspace setting file is located under the `~/.vscode` folder in your project, and the user settings file usually is located by default here:

> - Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
> - Mac $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
> - Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json

<br>

## Usability and implementation

- Replace your settings.json in visual studio code for this one and check the usability..
- Install the extension 'manager extension': "extensions/install/manager-extension".
- Run this command in your vscode to install each necessary extension directly from this settings.json:

  > (Shift + command + P) and look for with (>)
  >
  > > Install Missing Extensions

- Select your folder icons: File > Preferences > File Icon Theme > "material-icon-theme"
- Close or Reopen Visual Studio Code to activate extensions

(Now, we can change, edit or replace something easily).
