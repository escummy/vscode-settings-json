# Contributing

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)

If you don't see your idea listed or to improve something, you can feel free to send a pull request.

## Workflow

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from the `main` branch.
2.  If you've changed the functionality, update the documentation.
3.  Issue that pull request!
